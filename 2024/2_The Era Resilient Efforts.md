## Introduction:
I deeply enjoy thinking about the problems and solutions that will thrust us into the future. A future, mind you, that will not come to be without individuals working relentlessly on contrarian, ideas with strong conviction. But, what this future looks like is not defined by a divine direction. It is an epoch crafted by our expectations, hopes, and dreams. At best, this future can ensure continued prosperity that aligns with the needs of humanity. At worst, it leads to the end of us.

In the past, our species has figured out how to allow for human life to sustain and prosper. Now, it is time for us to craft a resilient future that ensures current levels of prosperity do not diminish.

Today, I write to help myself hone in on the types of challenges and technologies that are of the utmost importance. Perhaps, the synthesis of these thoughts can help others define the types of challenges they can pursue to leave a lasting legacy in this world.

## The Recent Past:
There is intrinsic value in looking at the past to help understand what the future may look like. Sure, we could look back at every technological development throughout human history. But, that may be too granular.

Instead, I propose we break the history of technology into two segments, the first being sustainment and the second being prosperity.

From the dawn of man until roughly 4000 BCE, technology was mainly developed to sustain populations. During this time, we discovered fire, built structures, harnessed the power of agriculture, and implemented early forms of sanitation. It was an era where humans learned to craft technologies that perpetuated our survival.

Next, we entered an era of prosperity, which continued until the late 1970s. It was here where we harnessed energy, designed global communication systems, and developed efficient mechanisms for the transportation of goods and people. It was during this era that humanity learned to thrive by consistently developing technologies to decrease the effort needed for survival whilst increasing quality of life.

This era of prosperity continued not by replicating or scaling what had worked but by taking novel approaches to existing problems. For example, we didn’t just multiply the number of farmable acres but we made them more productive by continued crop domestication, development of the combine, and improved water management.

By the late 1970s, the Western world was thriving technologically. The internet was in its infancy, the United States had a ripping space program, and the first human conceived through in vitro fertilization had been born.

## Our Current Era:
In the 1980s a shift began to occur with the emergence of multinational corporations, globally sourced supply chains, and significant globalization. Around the world, life expectancy continued to rise, infant mortality declined, and it became clear that what had worked in the first world could be exported to improve the quality of life in third-world countries. In many ways, the human population was entering an era of resiliency. Ironically, this happened to coincide with the global centralization of supply chains.

I suspect the era we are at the beginning of could be best defined as an era of technological resiliency. In this era we will begin to experience a plateau in individual quality of life and shift resources to ensuring future generations experience the great levels of prosperity we see today. This era will be predicated on retaining our current sustainment and prosperity while minimizing existential risks to humanity.

By no means will this era be defined by the replication of preexisting technologies across different markets. It will require our most fundamental industries to be reworked from the ground up with novel approaches.

Technological resiliency will require humanity to develop drugs to defeat viruses, extend our lifespan, and create civilizations amongst the stars. If we are successful, this era of technological resiliency will negate any chance of an extension-level event for our species.

To further contextualize this notion of technological resiliency imagine the need to create a new self-sustaining city in an inherently inhospitable environment like the bottom of the Pacific Ocean or another planet. Technological resiliency is achieved when we can deploy new civilizations.

In many ways some of the most exciting companies today exhibit technological resiliency.

- SpaceX: Allowing access to other potentially habitable environments.

- OpenAI: Creating a large corpus of easily indexable human knowledge.

- Terra Power/Tesla: Minimizing the use of hydrocarbons to extend the habitability of Earth.

- Terray Therapeutics: Improving drug discovery.

- Ohalo Genetics: Genetically altering crops in ways that can minimize resource usage and maximize yield.

While exciting, this era will not be for the faint of heart. It will force us to ask questions of unfathomable importance. For example, to what extent should we deplete Earth’s resources to allow other civilizations to be created? Should we play God with the natural world by editing the genomes of various species? Are we okay with the moral implications of trapping a seemingly conscious being in Silicon?

These questions will pose significant challenges and moral dilemmas. Nevertheless, the risks associated with them are negligible compared to the risk of not reaching a point where such questions are relevant because they are not of immediate importance.


## Down to Earth:
While it is fun to think about the future of humanity hundreds or thousands of years in the future, to create lasting change we must think incrementally. Today, at an individual level, vocational endeavors should be selected by identifying the largest impact an individual could have on a technologically resilient effort over their lifetime.

Surely, Musk would love to be the person to make humanity a multi-planetary species and it seems as though this is the resilient effort he is pursuing. But functionally, his contribution is to manage the development of the transportation mechanism that will allow for that resilient effort to succeed.

The decomposition of these resilient objectives is of the utmost importance, otherwise, these sorts of endeavors are perceived to be too large for an individual to enact change. The key is to identify these resilient efforts.

## Where We Stand:
Suppose the objective of technological resiliency is to reach a point where we can deploy a new, self-sustaining, civilization. In that case, there is value in pointing out related leaps that have been made.

- On June 6th, 2024 the fourth integrated flight test of the SpaceX Starship launch vehicle was conducted. While the development of this rocket is still in its testing phase, recent results are promising.2

- The International Space Station has been continuously occupied since November 2nd, 2000, and contains an environmental control system capable of collecting and recycling water vapor and urine into drinkable water and O2 which minimizes resupply needs. 3

- Human Embryos can be frozen and stored for up to a decade and potentially longer. 4

- Over 16K pharmaceutical drugs have been discovered.5

- The United States has at least 13 companies developing cultured meats. 6

- Ohalo Genetics has recently developed a novel protein that allows for full gene replication from both the mother and father plant which can allow for yield gains of up to 50%-100%. 7

- With just 10.6 lbs of plutonium dioxide, the JPL Perseverance rover’s radioisotope power system (RPS) is expected to have a 14-year operational lifetime. 8

The list could go on but it is clear that the notion of technological resiliency is trending less in the direction of fiction and more towards science. It is hard to fathom the leaps that could be made over the next century if our current development trends were to continue.

## Resilient Efforts:
Fortunately, the identification of technologically resilient efforts is trivial as it frequently requires pondering how existing industries can be scaled down to their absolute minimum. Unfortunately, this act of scaling will prove to be the most arduous technical effort the world has ever experienced.

To start, here are a few technologically resilient efforts worth considering:

**Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Medical Diagnostics:**

- What would small-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing look like? Could X of the most commonly used drugs be synthesized with only Y base ingredients? (X>Y)

- How small could a blood diagnostics testing system be made? (i.e. Theranos but no fraud)

**Manufacture-Recycle-Manufacture Goods:**

- In a mass-limited environment could infrequently used items be manufactured specifically for recycling? For example, one day you need a socket set the next day you need a hammer. Could these tools be made and remade from the same piece of steel efficiently?

- Out of all the objects you own, what percent of them could be created with the same material?

**Synthetic Foods and Minimal Volume Farming:**

- Can humans live off an entirely synthetic diet? What vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients do we need? (The food pyramid has flipped since I first learned it. Nutrition is not solved.)

- What is the absolute minimum grow volume needed to fully feed a single human? What are the minimum resources and nutrients needed to grow that food?

**Decentralized Energy:**

- What would the world look like if we had no centralized energy supply chain? How would we make every house, building, or neighborhood completely self-sufficient from an energy perspective?

**Resource Creation:**

- Will we ever reach a point where we can create vast numbers of elements from elementary particles through fusion or fission? Could we reach a point where we don’t need to find resources but could make them out of anything?

To find success, these efforts need to be aligned with current needs whilst allowing for notable progression toward resiliency. For example, SpaceX would not be around today if its only objective was to colonize Mars. There simply is no market to fund that venture. But, by greatly minimizing the cost per unit mass to orbit they have found a product-market fit that aligns with the development of their resilient objective. The most valuable companies to be created will also exhibit this alignment between current needs and future resiliency.

## Conclusion:
At times it is easy to look back at the last 35-45 years and wonder if stagnation has occurred. Day to day, our quality of life has seemingly started to plateau. But, intuitively I see this plateau as a logical progression in the human experience. It would be irrational to think of prosperity as an unbounded trend. And quite frankly, life in the developed world today can be pretty damn great.

I reckon that reframing our perspective from an era where technology is primarily used for prosperity to an era where technology is primarily used for resiliency will augment progress by reorienting our technical development compass. Soon we will realize that stagnation in technological prosperity is required to allow for growth of technological resiliency.

We stand on the precipitous of a transformative epoch, where innovation and resilience will redefine our existence. Let's embrace this new era with curiosity, for the journey ahead is not just about sustaining what we have but about ensuring it continues for the generations that follow.
